# Download Manager

This stack creates services to support and manage a BitTorrent and a Usenet clients. BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing in  a distributed, decentralized infrastructure. Usenet is an early non-centralized computer network for the discussion of particular topics and the sharing of files via newsgroups.

For more information, refer to [What is BitTorrent?](https://help.bittorrent.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000039924-what-is-bittorrent-) from BitTorrent and [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) from Wikipedia.

## Containers

> The Deluge VPN and all *arr container images are created by [binhex](https://github.com/binhex).

* [Deluge VPN](https://github.com/binhex/arch-delugevpn) is a full-featured â€‹BitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows. This Docker includes OpenVPN and WireGuard to ensure a secure and private connection to the Internet, including use of iptables to prevent IP leakage when the tunnel is down. It also includes Privoxy to allow unfiltered access to index sites, to use Privoxy please point your application at http://<host ip>:8118.

* [Deemix](https://deemix.app/) is a barebone deezer downloader library built from the ashes of Deezloader Remix.

* [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) is a proxy server to bypass Cloudflare and DDoS-GUARD protection.

* [Lidarr](https://github.com/binhex/arch-lidarr) is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

* [Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/tobbez/deluge_exporter) A Prometheus exporter for Deluge.

* [Prowlarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/binhex/arch-prowlarr) (custom image) is a indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Readarr offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).

* [Radarr](https://github.com/binhex/arch-radarr) is a fork of Sonarr aims to turn it into something like Couchpotato.

* [SABnzbd VPN](https://github.com/binhex/arch-sabnzbdvpn) is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

* [Sonarr](https://github.com/binhex/arch-sonarr) is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

# BitTorrent

This stack creates services to support and manage a BitTorrent client. BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing in  a distributed, decentralized infrastructure.

For more information, refer to [What is BitTorrent?](https://help.bittorrent.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000039924-what-is-bittorrent-) from BitTorrent.

## Containers

> The Deluge VPN and all *arr container images are created by [binhex](https://github.com/binhex).

* [Deluge VPN](https://github.com/binhex/arch-delugevpn) is a full-featured â€‹BitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows. This Docker includes OpenVPN and WireGuard to ensure a secure and private connection to the Internet, including use of iptables to prevent IP leakage when the tunnel is down. It also includes Privoxy to allow unfiltered access to index sites, to use Privoxy please point your application at http://<host ip>:8118.

* [Lidarr](https://github.com/binhex/arch-lidarr) is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) is a simple webserver with php support. This enables the stack to expose the web UIs of the individual applications using a centralized IP address in the host's network.

* [Sonarr](https://github.com/binhex/arch-sonarr) is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

* [Radarr](https://github.com/binhex/arch-radarr) is a fork of Sonarr aims to turn it into something like Couchpotato.

* [Prowlarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/binhex/arch-prowlarr) (custom image) is a indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Readarr offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).

## Exposed ports

The `WEBUI_IPADDR` will export a port `80/TCP` to serve a virtual server that will serve `deluge`, `lidarr`, `radarr`, `sonarr` and `prowlarr` web UIs based on the domain used. These domains are configurable in the [nginx.conf](./res/nginx.conf) file.

This stack will not expose the individual ports used by any application apart from port `80/TCP`. However, use the following addresses when configuring these applications:
* `deluge-vpn` address: `http://10.81.12.2:8112/`
* `lidarr` address: `http://10.81.12.3:8686/`
* `prowlarr` address: `http://10.81.12.8:9696/`
* `radarr` (FHD) address: `http://10.81.12.4:7878/`
* `radarr` (UHD) address: `http://10.81.12.5:7878/`
* `sonarr` (Anime) address: `http://10.81.12.6:8989/`
* `sonarr` (TV Series) address: `http://10.81.12.7:8989/`
